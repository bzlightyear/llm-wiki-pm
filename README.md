> A Claude Code skill that turns your PM work into a persistent, compounding
> knowledge base. Ingest meetings, analyst reports, and strategy docs.
> Query across months of context. Let the agent handle the bookkeeping.

Based on [Andrej Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f),
tuned for product management: competitive intel, customer notes, strategy,
roadmap, AI market tracking.

## Why

Most PM work today spreads across Slack threads, meeting transcripts, analyst
PDFs, and one-off notes. RAG tools like NotebookLM retrieve from raw sources
each query, so knowledge never compounds. Personal wikis fail because the
bookkeeping overhead outgrows the value.

This skill gives you the middle path: you curate sources, the agent maintains
an interlinked markdown wiki that stays current. Every ingest touches 5-15
pages. Every query cites specific wiki entries. The wiki compounds.

## What you get

- **Three-layer architecture**: immutable `raw/` sources, agent-owned wiki
  pages, and `SCHEMA.md` governing structure
- **Ingest / query / update / lint / archive** flows with discipline guardrails
- **Supersession** with auto-redirect of inbound links
- **Crystallize** pattern: transcripts become structured decision digests
- **Privacy-first**: pre-ingest filter + private-by-default pages (only `shareable: true` pages are exported)
- **Bundled wiki-search**: semantic + TF-IDF search over your whole wiki (auto-indexes on startup)
- **Obsidian-compatible**: works as a vault out of the box
- **Worker agents**: five subagents (indexer, fetcher, link-validator, lint, people-updater)
  handle expensive ops without bloating the lead session
- **Role packs**: PM, researcher, executive, founder personas tune proactive
  recall sensitivity, output format, and crystallize templates per session
- **Sub-skills** (optional, install as needed):
  - `llm-wiki-brief` — daily/weekly briefs, tag digests, coverage brief
  - `llm-wiki-prd` — PRD drafts, user stories, release notes (wiki-grounded, no fabrication)
  - `llm-wiki-research` — research sprints, competitive deep dives, stub enrichment
  - `llm-wiki-crm` — relationship health, account health dashboard, feature ask tracker, auto-enrichment
  - `llm-wiki-persona` — communication persona pages and relationship maps, grounded in real message samples
  - `llm-wiki-maintain` — the daily-maintenance loop (registry-driven sweep → ingest → brief → tidy → health check), with interactive vs autonomous modes
- **MY-INTEGRATIONS.md**: learned source routing — auto-populated from actual ingest activity
- **Next.js embed path** for platform deployments

## Install

### Option A: Claude Code plugin (recommended)

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add anh-chu/llm-wiki-pm
claude plugin install llm-wiki-pm@anh-chu-plugins
```

### Option B: Standalone skill via `npx skills`

```bash
npx skills add anh-chu/llm-wiki-pm --skill llm-wiki-pm -a claude-code -g
```

Install individual sub-skills the same way:

```bash
npx skills add anh-chu/llm-wiki-pm --skill llm-wiki-crm -a claude-code -g
npx skills add anh-chu/llm-wiki-pm --skill llm-wiki-brief -a claude-code -g
```

This installs the skill with all its scripts, templates, and references. **What you don't get** without the full plugin: session hooks (auto-scaffold, wikilink validation, log rotation), worker agents, and role packs. Core wiki operations (ingest, query, update, lint) work fine — you just need to create the wiki directory structure manually on first use.

### Option C: Symlink from a clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anh-chu/llm-wiki-pm ~/llm-wiki-pm
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
ln -s ~/llm-wiki-pm/skills/llm-wiki-pm ~/.claude/skills/llm-wiki-pm
```

Same trade-offs as Option B. For hook automation and auto-scaffold, also install the plugin:

```bash
claude plugin install llm-wiki-pm@anh-chu-plugins
```

### Then: start Claude Code
Restart Claude Code after enabling the plugin. You will be prompted for your wiki path and domain. The `SessionStart` hook creates the wiki directory on the first session start.

If you used Option B without installing the plugin, set `WIKI_PATH` before starting Claude Code:
```bash
echo 'export WIKI_PATH=$HOME/pm-wiki' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

### Recommended: permission rules for wiki-search

The wiki-search MCP's `edit` tool rewrites the whole page on most operations,
which escapes `[[wikilinks]]` as `\[\[` (wirux/mcp-markdown-vault#47) and turns
dates into timestamps (#49). The built-in Edit tool does everything it does, so
deny it. Its `vault` tool can also delete pages, so have it ask first. A plugin
can't install permission rules, so add them to `~/.claude/settings.json`
yourself. Each tool is listed under both of its names: the first when the
server is configured directly, the second when it comes with the plugin.

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": ["mcp__wiki-search__edit", "mcp__plugin_llm-wiki-pm_wiki-search__edit"],
    "ask": ["mcp__wiki-search__vault", "mcp__plugin_llm-wiki-pm_wiki-search__vault"]
  }
}
```

The `ask` rule also prompts on `vault` reads, which agents rarely make, since
reads go through the `view` tool.

[GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md).

## Target users

Good fit if you:

- Work as a PM, analyst, researcher, or founder with lots of meetings and reports
- Want a local-first, markdown-based knowledge base that you own
- Use Claude Code as your primary agent
- Are comfortable on a terminal (you'll occasionally run `lint.py`)

Not a fit if you:

- Want a zero-terminal SaaS → use NotebookLM
- Need team collaboration out of the box → use Notion or a shared Obsidian vault
- Don't use Claude Code → `AGENTS.md` is the portable reference if you want to port to another agent

## Setup

Two scenarios documented in detail in [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md):

1. **Human user with Claude Code**: enable plugin, wiki auto-scaffolds on first session
2. **Application-orchestrated**: programmatic wiki provisioning for platform deployments

## Quick Start

### 1. Bootstrap a wiki
Enable the plugin. When prompted, enter your wiki path and domain.
On the first session start, the `SessionStart` hook creates:
`~/pm-wiki/` with SCHEMA.md, index.md, log.md, overview.md, and
the raw/entities/concepts/comparisons/queries/_archive subdirectories.

### 1b. Wiki search (bundled, automatic)

Semantic + TF-IDF search over your wiki is bundled via `wiki-search`
(`@wirux/mcp-markdown-vault`). It auto-indexes on startup — no setup needed.
~80MB model downloads on first use, cached in `.markdown_vault_mcp/` inside
your wiki directory. Add `.markdown_vault_mcp/` to `.gitignore`.

### 2. Review SCHEMA.md

Open `~/pm-wiki/SCHEMA.md`. Adjust:
- Domain statement (scope)
- Tag taxonomy (add/remove tags for your specific accounts, competitors, themes)
- Page thresholds (tune later after a few ingests)

### 3. Install as Claude Code skill

Option A, user-level (available in every project):
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
ln -s /home/sil/llm-wiki-pm/skills/llm-wiki-pm ~/.claude/skills/llm-wiki-pm
```

Option B, project-level (per-repo):
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills
ln -s /home/sil/llm-wiki-pm/skills/llm-wiki-pm .claude/skills/llm-wiki-pm
```

Restart Claude Code. Verify with `/skills`, `llm-wiki-pm` should appear.
The skill auto-activates on ingest/query/update/lint phrasing (see SKILL.md
"When This Skill Activates").

### 4. First ingest

In Claude Code:

> "Ingest this Gartner Magic Quadrant report: <paste or path>"

Claude reads SKILL.md, orients on SCHEMA + index + log + overview, surfaces
takeaways, creates/updates pages, logs.

### 5. Run lint periodically

```bash
python3 /home/sil/llm-wiki-pm/skills/llm-wiki-pm/scripts/lint.py ~/pm-wiki
# opens queries/lint-YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

### 6. Mobile access (optional)

See `references/obsidian-sync.md` for obsidian-headless + systemd setup.

## Workflow Patterns

**Weekly competitive digest**: ingest 3-5 analyst links in one session.
Batch updates, one log entry, refresh overview.md.

**Pre-meeting prep**: query "what do we know about <customer>?" → Claude
reads `entities/<customer>.md` + recent log → offer to file post-meeting update.

**Monthly 1:1 follow-up**: ingest transcript → extract decisions/themes →
update relevant concept pages → link from person page.

**Quarterly review**: lint, triage, rotate log, refresh overview, prune
tag taxonomy.

## Scope

Wiki = long-term curated facts + sources you review, cite, and share with
colleagues. Not a replacement for session memory or notes apps. If you pair
with a memory tool (Claude's native memory, mem0, Hindsight), keep them
non-overlapping: wiki holds facts + sources, memory holds persona + session
state.

## Tests

Hook scripts and plugin manifest validation:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install pytest pyyaml -q
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests cover scaffold, wikilink validation, log rotation, stdin parsing,
plugin manifest compliance, lint, the write hooks, the frontmatter parser
(`wikifm.py`) and the conversation-capture script (`capture.py`). Hook tests
create isolated temp wikis and feed the real Claude Code hook JSON schema to
the scripts. The parser tests check it against PyYAML,
and skip that check when PyYAML isn't installed. To also parse every page of a
real wiki, set `WIKIFM_WIKI` (the tests only read it):

```bash
WIKIFM_WIKI=~/pm-wiki .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_wikifm.py
```

## Design notes

How this skill maps to Karpathy's original gist and Rohit's v2 extensions:

### Karpathy core (10/10)

- Three-layer architecture (raw sources, agent-owned wiki, schema)
- LLM owns the wiki; human curates sources
- Ingest / query / lint operations
- `index.md` content catalog + `log.md` chronological record
- File good answers back as pages (`queries/` dir)
- Obsidian compatibility (Graph, Dataview, frontmatter)
- Schema as key configuration, co-evolved
- Ingests touch 10-15 pages routinely
- Bundled semantic wiki-search via `@wirux/mcp-markdown-vault`
- Multi-format outputs: [Marp, matplotlib, CSV, Mermaid, Canvas](references/output-formats.md)

### v2 cherry-picks (7/16)

Implemented:

- Explicit supersession with `supersedes:` / `superseded_by:` fields + auto-redirect
- Privacy filter (pre-ingest checklist + private-by-default export allowlist, `shareable: true`)
- Self-healing lint (`--auto-fix` for safe repairs)
- Crystallization (transcript → decision digest)
- Schema as the real product
- Contradiction handling with frontmatter flag
- Backlink tracing (`scripts/backlinks.py` for structural refs)

Intentionally skipped for solo PM use (overkill):

- Confidence decay curves
- Consolidation tiers (working/episodic/semantic/procedural memory)
- Typed knowledge graph with relationship types
- Multi-agent mesh sync
- Quality scoring pipeline
