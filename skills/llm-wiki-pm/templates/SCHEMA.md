# Wiki Schema, PM

## Domain

Product management knowledge base. Scope (customize to your space):
- Competitive landscape (your market and adjacent categories)
- Customer relations (accounts, sales/SE insights)
- Strategy (your products, AI direction, migrations, pricing)
- Internal org (people, teams, decisions, OKRs)
- AI market intelligence (models, tools, vendors, trends)
- Roadmap and product health signals

Out of scope: code specifics. Personal life.

## Conventions

- Filenames: lowercase, hyphens, no spaces. E.g. `competitor-x.md`, `product-launch.md`
- Every wiki page starts with YAML frontmatter (below)
- `[[wikilinks]]` between pages, minimum 2 outbound per page
- Bump `updated:` date on any edit
- Every new page → add to `index.md` under correct section
- Every action → append to `log.md`
- No em-dashes. Natural human tone. No AI tells.

## Frontmatter

## Tag Taxonomy

Every tag on a page must appear here. Add new tags here FIRST, then use.

### Entities
- `company`, external org (competitor, partner, customer)
- `product`, named product or SKU
- `person`, named individual (internal or external)
- `persona`, communication style and language profile for a person
- `team`, org unit (sales, SE, data, eng)
- `model`, AI model (GPT-5, Claude, Llama, etc.)
- `vendor`, tool/platform provider

### Domains
- `competitive`, rival positioning, pricing, features
- `customer`, named account, segment, persona
- `strategy`, direction, positioning, bet
- `roadmap`, planned or shipped work
- `ai`, AI features, market, models
- `migration`, customer migration work
- `enterprise`, enterprise-specific
- `pricing`, pricing, packaging, monetization
- `gtm`, sales, marketing, SE enablement

### Meta
- `comparison`, side-by-side
- `timeline`, chronological synthesis
- `decision`, recorded decision + rationale
- `risk`, identified risk, mitigation
- `question`, open question to investigate
- `prediction`, forward-looking claim with date

### Domain-specific (replace these with your own products/orgs)
- `product-a`, your primary product
- `product-b`, an adjacent product (relevant but not your scope)
- `ai-product`, your AI product line
- `internal`, internal org/people

Rule: tag sprawl kills wikis. Max ~40 tags. Consolidate quarterly.

## Page Thresholds

- **Create** when entity/concept appears in 2+ sources OR is central to one source
- **Person entities**: same rule applies. When a named person appears in 2+ sources, or is the central subject of one source, create `entities/<slug>.md`. When a concept page accumulates 3+ distinct attributes for a person (role, employer, decisions, relationships), that person meets the entity threshold and should be promoted to their own page.
- **Update** existing page for new info on covered ground
- **Don't create** for passing mentions, footnote name-drops, out-of-scope items
- **Split** when page > 200 lines, break by sub-topic with cross-links. Follow the
  split procedure in the skill's `references/citation-spec.md` and set each page's
  sources with `lint.py --cited-sources`
- **Archive** when fully superseded, move to `_archive/`, remove from index

## Entity Pages

Fields:
- Overview (what it is, 1-2 paragraphs)
- Key facts (dates, numbers, positions)
- Relationships (`[[wikilinks]]` to related entities)
- Relevance to our work (why this matters for your PM work)
- Source references

Person entity additional fields (when available):
- Org relationships (`reports_to`, `direct_reports`, `peers`)
- Interaction frequency (daily / weekly / project-based)
- Link to persona page: `[[person-name-persona]]`
- When 3+ person entities exist in the wiki, auto-generate
  `concepts/relationship-map.md` with an org chart table and interaction tiers

## Concept Pages

Fields:
- Definition / framing
- Current state (what we know, when verified)
- Open questions
- Related concepts (`[[wikilinks]]`)
- Decisions or bets tied to this concept

## Comparison Pages

Fields:
- What is being compared, why
- Dimensions (table format)
- Verdict / synthesis
- Sources
- Implications for us

## Query Pages (filed answers)

Fields:
- Question
- Answer (synthesis)
- Pages drawn from
- Date asked
- Filed because: [reason it's worth keeping]

## Persona Pages

Type: `persona`. One page per person. Slug: `<name>-persona.md`.

Fields:
- Core traits summary (3-5 lines)
- Communication channels (one section per channel the person actually uses —
  substitute their stack; the labels below are common examples, not a fixed set):
  - **Private chat** (Slack/Teams/Discord DM): formality, language, message length, humor, sign-off
  - **Public chat channel**: formality, language, message length, humor, sign-off
  - **Email internal**: formality, language, message length, humor, sign-off
  - **Email external**: formality, language, message length, humor, sign-off
- Cross-channel comparison table (auto-generated from channel sections)
- Vocabulary markers (hedging, humor style, sign-offs, code-switching)
- Source notes (what conversations or messages informed this analysis)

Always link back to the corresponding person entity page (`[[person-name]]`).
Always confirm with user which tiers have actual source data before generating.

## Update Policy

Conflicting info:
1. Check dates, newer sources generally supersede
2. If genuinely contradictory, note both with dates + sources
3. Mark in frontmatter: `contradictions: [other-page]`
4. Flag in next lint for user review
5. Never silently overwrite

## Mass Updates

If an ingest or update touches 10+ pages, confirm scope with user before
writing. Show the list. Get sign-off.
## Supersession Policy

When a new page materially replaces an old one (not just revises it):

1. New page frontmatter: `supersedes: [old-slug]`
2. Old page frontmatter: `superseded_by: new-slug`
3. Don't delete the old page, keep for audit trail
4. Move old page to `_archive/` if fully replaced
5. Rewrite inbound `[[old-slug]]` links to `[[new-slug]]` (lint --auto-fix does this)
6. Log: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] supersede | old-slug → new-slug`

Revision (same page, new info) is NOT supersession, use Update flow instead.

## Privacy Policy

PM sources contain sensitive data: customer names, account IDs, deal sizes,
internal strategy, 1:1 content. **Every page is private by default** — excluded
from any export/share unless it explicitly carries `shareable: true`. Before
ingesting:

1. Strip obvious PII (emails, phone numbers, customer employee names if not
   public) from raw source text if you're not comfortable with them in the wiki
2. Leave pages unflagged (private). Add `shareable: true` ONLY to pages that are
   genuinely safe to share — built from public sources, no PII/deal/1:1 content.
3. Exports include only `shareable: true` pages; an unflagged page can never leak.
4. Customer names in competitive contexts: use internal codes
   (e.g. `customer-alpha`) even on a shareable page if real names would be unsafe.

Privacy filter checklist before every ingest:
- [ ] Any API keys, tokens, passwords in the source? → strip before saving to raw/
- [ ] Is this page genuinely public-safe? → only then add `shareable: true`
- [ ] Public-sourced competitor/market/framework page with no PII? → `shareable: true` candidate
- [ ] Anything customer/deal/1:1/internal-strategy? → leave unflagged (stays private)

## Confidence Levels

Optional `confidence:` frontmatter field:

- `verified`, multiple independent sources, recently confirmed
- `likely`, single credible source, plausible
- `rumor`, single low-credibility source, unconfirmed, hearsay

Use sparingly, mostly for competitive intel and market claims where
source quality varies. Not needed for internal facts.

### Confidence Decay

Optional `confidence_decay_days:` frontmatter field (integer or null).

Sets the number of days after which the page should be flagged as potentially
stale and unverified. Default behavior:

- `competitive`-tagged pages: 60 days (applied automatically during orient)
- All other pages: null (no decay, rely on standard staleness thresholds)

Set explicitly on any page where time-sensitivity matters:

```yaml
confidence_decay_days: 30   # e.g. for fast-moving pricing pages
```

The orient step (step ⑦) greps for competitive-tagged pages and flags any with
`updated:` older than their decay threshold. The `_status.md` hook pre-computes
this check so it's instant at session start.

### Coverage Markers

Optional `coverage:` frontmatter field:

- `stub`: bare entity with minimal facts, needs research
- `partial`: some sections filled but known gaps remain
- `comprehensive`: all known sections covered, actively maintained

Pair with `gaps:` list on stub/partial pages to track what's missing:

```yaml
coverage: partial
gaps: ["pricing model unknown", "no recent competitive data"]
```

Used by Coverage Audit (§12) and surfaced in Proactive Recall. Helps the user
know whether to trust a page's completeness or dig deeper.

### Inline Provenance

Every non-obvious factual claim in a wiki page must carry an inline source
marker citing the ID of a source declared in `sources:`:

```markdown
Vendor X holds ~15% market share in region Y [source: gartner-mq-2026, p.12]
```

Without inline markers, updates silently corrupt provenance because the agent
can't tell which source backs which claim. The grammar, how IDs resolve, and how
to capture a fact stated in conversation are in the skill's
`references/citation-spec.md`.

### Grounding (anti-self-reinforcement)

A wiki is only as good as the fresh information fed into it. Every knowledge
page must trace to at least one **primary source**: a record in `raw/` (a
captured web page, document, transcript, chat or email thread, warehouse
snapshot, or conversation). A page whose `sources:`
point only to *other wiki pages* is self-referential: it launders secondhand
mentions into false confidence (e.g. a person mislabeled by role because that's
all the linked pages happened to say). Lint flags this:

- 🔴 **self-referential factual page** (`entity` / `concept` / `comparison` /
  `persona` with no primary source) — verify against live tools and add a `raw/`
  source before trusting it.
- 🟡 **self-referential synthesis page** (`query` / `summary`) — synthesis may
  cite wiki pages, but a synthesis of ungrounded pages is still ungrounded.
- 🟡 **no inline `[source:]` markers** on a substantive factual page.
- 🟡 **stale `last_verified`** (>120 days) — re-check live sources.

Before creating or materially updating any page, sweep connected tools for newer
primary sources (see the Freshness-first protocol in the skill). Stamp
`last_verified:` when you confirm a page against a live source.
