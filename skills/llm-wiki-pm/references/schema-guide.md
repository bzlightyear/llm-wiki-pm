# Schema Guide

SCHEMA.md governs the wiki. Customize it upfront. Revisit quarterly.

## When to edit SCHEMA.md

- Starting a new domain or sub-domain
- Adding a new tag (do this BEFORE using the tag)
- Adjusting page thresholds (too many trivial pages? raise the bar)
- Changing frontmatter requirements
- Updating the update policy

## Tag taxonomy discipline

Rule: every tag on any page must exist in SCHEMA.md.

Workflow when you want a new tag:
1. Stop. Edit SCHEMA.md. Add the tag under the right section with a one-line gloss.
2. Commit / save SCHEMA.md.
3. Now use the tag.

Why: freeform tags decay. After 6 months you have `ai`, `AI`, `ai-tools`,
`aitools`, `artificialintelligence`, all slightly different, all unsearchable.
Enforced taxonomy prevents this.

## Page threshold tuning

Default: create a page when an entity appears in 2+ sources OR is central to one.

Signals to raise the bar (fewer pages):
- Lint reports 40%+ orphans
- You can't remember what half the entity pages are for
- You're creating pages for competitors mentioned once in a footnote

Signals to lower the bar (more pages):
- You keep re-reading raw sources because info isn't filed
- Queries return nothing because the entity isn't a page
- Important people don't have pages yet

## Frontmatter extensions

Add fields for PM-specific signals:

```yaml
relevance: high | medium | low    # How much this matters to our strategy
last_reviewed: 'YYYY-MM-DD'       # When a human last eyeballed it
owner: pm | manager | data-team   # Who owns verifying this
confidence: verified | likely | rumor
lifecycle: stub-intentional       # By-design thin page (see below)
```

Add these to the "Frontmatter" section in SCHEMA.md when you adopt them.

### `confidence` and `coverage` are independent axes

These two fields measure different things and must not be collapsed:

- **`confidence`** = *source reliability*. How trustworthy is the underlying
  signal? `verified` (direct from an authoritative source — a source DB, a
  signed contract, the person themselves), `likely` (corroborated but indirect),
  `rumor` (single weak/unconfirmed mention).
- **`coverage`** = *completeness*. How much of the page's subject is actually
  filled in? `full`, `partial`, `stub`.

A page can legitimately be **`confidence: verified` + `coverage: stub`** — e.g. a
warehouse-sourced account page with hard ARR/usage numbers straight from the
source DB (verified fact) but zero engagement/relationship context yet (stub
coverage). Do NOT downgrade `confidence` to `likely` just because coverage is
thin; that misreports authoritative data as shaky. Keep the axes orthogonal.

### `lifecycle: stub-intentional`

Daily ingest legitimately creates thin pages awaiting future signal — fresh
warehouse/account stubs, escalation placeholders. These are correct, not
oversights, but they instantly become zero-inbound orphans and pollute the
health metrics, re-flagged every session (alarm fatigue).

Mark such pages `lifecycle: stub-intentional`. `lint.py` exempts them from the
orphan warning (counted as info instead). Drop the flag once the page earns
real backlinks or grows past stub coverage.

### `lifecycle: dated-digest`

Dated one-shot pages — daily briefs, synthesis digests, weekly-sync notes — are
orphans *by design*: nothing links back to a `briefings/2026-06-24.md`. Without
a flag they ratchet the orphan count up every single day you do the job
(orphans climbing 7→14 over a few days of normal use is the symptom). Stamp
these `lifecycle: dated-digest` when you create them; `lint.py` exempts them
from the orphan warning the same way as intentional stubs. (Generated
`lint-*.md` reports are already skipped by lint entirely.)

## Domain pivots

If scope shifts (e.g., one product line becomes the whole company focus):
1. Update `## Domain` in SCHEMA.md
2. Run lint to identify now-out-of-scope pages
3. Archive or re-tag as needed
4. Update tag taxonomy, prune dead categories
5. Refresh `overview.md`
