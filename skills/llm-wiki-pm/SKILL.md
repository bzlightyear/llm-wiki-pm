# LLM Wiki PM

Persistent knowledge base for PM work. Non-coding. Domain: product strategy,
competitive landscape, customer relations, roadmap, AI market, internal org.

Markdown files in a directory. Readable in Obsidian, VS Code, any editor.
The agent writes. You curate sources, ask questions, steer.

## When This Skill Activates
- User asks a question about PM knowledge, competitive intel, customers, strategy, or roadmap
- User asks to update/revise a page, or to lint/audit/health-check the wiki
- User asks to create or bootstrap a PM wiki, or references "my wiki / knowledge base / notes"
- **Natural memory phrases**: "remember that", "note that", "don't forget", "keep
  in mind", "save this", "log this", "make a note", "record that" → treat as a
  wiki ingest (see §2 micro-capture fast path). Ask which page if unclear.
- "I have a meeting/call/1:1 with [person]" → §9 Pre-Meeting Briefing
- "What happened this week / recently?" → §10 Catch Me Up
- "[tag] digest" / "catch me up on [topic]" → §11 Tag Digest
- "What am I missing?", "blind spots?", "coverage gaps?" → §12 Coverage Audit
- "What did we learn?", "capture learnings" → §13 Learn
- After a substantive PM task, Proactive Behavior B offers to capture learnings

## Sub-skills (route to these)

Route to these — including **mid-flow** when a core operation surfaces the need:

| Need | Sub-skill | Triggers |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Communication persona pages, relationship maps, org charts | `llm-wiki-persona` | "build a persona", "communication profile", "map relationships" |
| Daily/weekly briefs, tag digests, coverage briefs | `llm-wiki-brief` | "daily/weekly brief", "catch me up", "[tag] digest" |
| PRDs, user stories, release notes | `llm-wiki-prd` | "write a PRD", "user stories", "release notes" |
| Research sprints, competitive deep dives, stub enrichment | `llm-wiki-research` | "research [topic]", "deep dive", "auto-research [entity]" |
| Relationship/account health, CRM context, touchpoints | `llm-wiki-crm` | "relationship health", "account health", "who haven't I talked to" |
| Daily-maintenance loop (sweep all sources → ingest → brief → tidy), incl. scheduled runs | `llm-wiki-maintain` | "daily maintenance", "morning sweep", "ingest all sources and brief", "do the daily run" |

If a sub-skill isn't installed, the core skill's matching fallback handles it where
one exists (§10/§11/§12); persona, PRD, research, CRM, and maintain require their
sub-skill (you can still run maintenance steps manually via core ingest/brief/lint).

## Proactive Behaviors

Fire whenever the skill is loaded. Append notes briefly *after* your answer, never
before. Searches: wiki-search `semantic_search` preferred, grep fallback.
**Limits:** max 1 suggestion per turn; skip during code/debug tasks; PM-domain
facts not already addressed; never auto-write.

**A. Entity-aware recall & contradiction.** When the user mentions a named
company/person/product (not just in passing), search the wiki; if a page exists,
surface it in one line with its `confidence:`/`coverage:` and `updated:` date.
Always flag `rumor` confidence: "Wiki has [[page]] (rumor, unverified). Treat with
caution." If the user's statement conflicts with the page, note it: "This may
conflict with [[page]] from YYYY-MM-DD. Which is current?" For a named person,
fold in 1-2 relevant traits from `entities/<name>-persona.md` if present.

**B. Capture offer (facts, decisions, open questions).** When the user states a
wikifiable PM fact, a decision ("we decided", "going with X"), or asks a factual
question the wiki can't answer, offer to capture it — *after* a mandatory **dedup
search** of the statement's key noun phrases. If a page already holds the claim,
offer an update, don't duplicate: "Already in [[page]] (updated YYYY-MM-DD). Update
it?" Decisions → a `decision`-tagged page (who, when, rationale). Unanswerable
questions → a `question`-tagged page under `queries/`. After a substantive PM task
(research, ingest, briefing, strategy), self-audit once for uncaptured items and
offer §13 Learn. Skip casual chat, hypotheticals, and anything already captured.

*(Tool-discovery suggestions live in `references/recommended-tools.md` — surface
one only when a query would clearly be richer with an unconnected tool.)*

## Wiki Location
Before any bash command using `$WIKI`, resolve it:
```bash
WIKI=$(cat .wiki-path 2>/dev/null | tr -d '[:space:]')
WIKI=${WIKI:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_wiki_path:-${WIKI_PATH:-$(pwd)}}}
```
Resolution: `.wiki-path` (project) → `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_wiki_path` (global) →
`WIKI_PATH` → cwd. Run `/llm-wiki-pm:set-wiki-path ~/path` to set a project path.
The SessionStart hook states the active path each session.

## Session Defaults

**Wiki-first protocol:** Before answering a PM knowledge question, search the wiki
with connected tools. Don't synthesize from training data when wiki pages exist.
Cite explicitly: "Per [[page]]...". If no page exists, say so and offer to create
one or log an open question.

**Source discipline (the wiki is a map, not the territory):** wiki-first must not
become wiki-only. Verify from source; use the wiki to know where to look. Four
guards govern this — the full detail and rationale are in
`references/source-discipline.md` (read it before a substantive ingest, a
multi-source sweep, or any decision-bearing/exec-facing synthesis). The input side
is largely enforced by the `pre-write.sh` freshness gate and `lint.py`
(self-referential sourcing, missing inline provenance). In brief:

- **Freshness-first guard.** Before writing/updating a page, sweep connected tools
  for newer primary sources and anchor claims with inline `[source:]` markers;
  don't build a page from other pages' prose. One batch sweep covers a batch
  operation. Distinguish "wiki says X (as of date)" from "live sources confirm X today".
- **Source-completeness guard.** For any multi-source sweep, enumerate the
  **canonical sweep registry** in `$WIKI/MY-INTEGRATIONS.md` (`## Sweep Registry`)
  and cover every source. Empty ≠ done: run ≥2 varied queries, then classify each
  source `hits` / `empty-after-retries` / `failed` and report all three — never
  collapse `failed`/`empty-after-retries` into "covered."
- **Source-depth guard.** A hit that *references* an artifact (attached file,
  linked doc, cited spec) is not the content. Open it before synthesizing; if you
  can't, flag it unread and don't write over it.
- **Provenance-tier & falsification guard.** Tier every asserted claim
  `computed` / `primary` / `recalled`; never state a recalled claim as fact in a
  decision-bearing answer without upgrading it against a primary source. Route
  targeting/pipeline/quantitative questions to the primary system (CRM, warehouse,
  Gong), not wiki prose. Before exec-facing synthesis, run a falsification pass:
  name and run the query that would disprove each headline claim.

**Session trust model:** Trust `.wiki-path` for location, `SCHEMA.md` for taxonomy
(new tags go there first), `log.md` for recent activity. Deviate only with explicit
user confirmation.

## Tool Selection Hierarchy

Inventory every connected MCP tool at session start and use them eagerly.

| Priority | Tools | When |
|----------|-------|------|
| 1 | **wiki-search** (bundled) — semantic + TF-IDF over wiki | Wiki queries, entity lookup, semantic recall |
| 2 | **MCP integrations** — Gmail, Slack, calendar, CRM, any connected MCP | Emails, threads, messages, events, enriching pages |
| 3 | **WebFetch / WebSearch** | External research, fetching pages for ingest |
| 4 | **grep** | Exact token match (dollar figures, codenames, frontmatter values) |
| 5 | **Read** | When you already know the exact file |

**wiki-search is an action dispatcher, not a bare command.** Call
`view(action=semantic_search|read|backlinks|outline, query=...)`; use
`view(action=global_search)` for exact phrases. (Bundled via
`@wirux/mcp-markdown-vault`, ~80MB model on first use.) Optional key-required tools:
`references/recommended-tools.md`.

**Rules:**
- **Connected tools first, file reads last.** Search before read; don't scan files sequentially.
- **Bound connected-tool output.** Broad chat/email/warehouse searches can return
  100K+ chars. Default to the tightest useful query: summary format, no message
  context, `limit`≤15, and **narrow scope (channel/author/label/date) BEFORE broad
  keyword**. Widen only if the narrow pass is empty. Dump-then-slice is a defect.
- **Date operators are soft on semantic backends.** Many treat `after:`/`before:`
  as advisory — verify each result's actual timestamp before trusting it as in-window.

## Architecture: Three Layers

`raw/` (Layer 1, immutable sources — agent reads, never modifies) → `entities/`,
`concepts/`, `comparisons/`, `queries/` (Layer 2, agent-owned pages) governed by
`SCHEMA.md` (Layer 3, taxonomy). Plus `index.md` (catalog), `overview.md`
(synthesis), `log.md` (append-only action log), `_status.md` (session-start health),
`_archive/` (snapshots + superseded). Full directory layout and `raw/` sub-routing:
`references/ingest-guide.md` and `references/schema-guide.md`.

## Pre-Flight Check

Run at session start before any operation. Proceed silently if all pass; narrate
only on a problem.

**① Wiki exists?** Resolve `$WIKI` (see Wiki Location); if the dir is missing:
"Wiki directory not found. Scaffold a new wiki or run `/llm-wiki-pm:set-wiki-path`."
**② SCHEMA.md exists?** If absent, offer to scaffold from `templates/SCHEMA.md`. No
write operation proceeds until it exists.
**③ MY-INTEGRATIONS.md (optional).** If present, apply its Routing Notes to ingest
defaults and read `## Sweep Registry` (canonical source list). No file = generic
defaults. Never create it during Pre-Flight (auto-created on first ingest).
**④ Role pack (optional).** Check `.claude/roles/` for a file matching the user's
role; if found apply `focus_tags`, `preferred_output_format`, `crystallize_template`,
`surface_confidence_threshold`. Missing dir is not an error.
**⑤ _status.md warnings.** If present, read it and surface staleness/lock warnings.

## Orient Every Session

Before any ingest/query/update/lint:

① Read `SCHEMA.md` — domain, conventions, tag taxonomy
② Read `index.md` — what pages exist
③ Read last 20-30 lines of `log.md` — recent activity
④ Read `overview.md` — current synthesis state
⑤ For 100+ page wikis: search before creating (`view(action=semantic_search)` or `grep -r`)
⑥ **Staleness warning:** if a page's `updated:` is older than 14 days
   (overview/index) or 30 days (entity/concept) AND `log.md` shows recent activity
   in that area, surface: "Warning: [[page]] may be stale (updated YYYY-MM-DD)."
⑦ **_status.md warnings** were surfaced in Pre-Flight ⑤; if Pre-Flight was skipped,
   read `$WIKI/_status.md` now. It also precomputes confidence-decay candidates.
⑧ **Orient gate (checklist):** before creating or modifying any wiki page, ensure
   ①-④ are done this session. If not: "Need to orient first. Running now." Then
   orient. Narrow read-only queries answerable from a single page read may skip it.

Skipping orientation → duplicate pages, missed cross-refs, schema drift.
(Bash-heavy orient/lint reads are required correctness work — a session hook that
caps raw output does not exempt you; route bulk through the hook's preferred path.
This skill's correctness and tone rules govern wiki work; see
`references/lint-guide.md` for harness-hook precedence detail.)

## Core Operations

### 1. Initialize (new wiki)
The SessionStart hook scaffolds the wiki automatically on first run (directory
structure + templates, using the domain set at plugin-enable). If it wasn't
auto-created, restart the session. After init, confirm domain scope and customize
`SCHEMA.md` taxonomy.

### 2. Ingest a source

**Micro-capture fast path** — for a SINGLE conversational fact ("remember that…",
a decision dropped in chat; `source: conversation | <date>`): skip the
ingest-guide read, crystallize, entity-promotion scan, and per-op freshness sweep.
Do exactly one mandatory step — a **dedup search** of the key noun (append to the
existing page, else create a small stub with frontmatter + ≥2 links) — then log it.
Still requires Orient once this session. Anything that is a file/URL/transcript/
warehouse/email/chat export, or a batch, uses the full flow below.

**Full ingest — read `references/ingest-guide.md` first** (raw-capture conventions,
page thresholds, inline provenance, privacy filter, crystallize, entity-promotion).
In brief:
① **Capture raw** to `raw/` (immutable), behind the privacy filter. Pages are
   private by default; add `shareable: true` only to genuinely public-safe pages.
② **Surface takeaways** before writing (skip in batch contexts).
③ **Check existing pages** — decide create vs update.
④ **Apply page thresholds** (2+ sources or central) and **enrich from connected
   tools BEFORE writing** (Freshness-first) — never build a page from other pages' prose.
⑤ **Write/update** with required frontmatter, taxonomy tags, ≥2 `[[wikilinks]]`,
   inline `[source: ...]` markers, and `coverage:`/`gaps:`/`confidence:` set.
⑥–⑧ Backlink audit; refresh `overview.md` if synthesis shifts; update `index.md`;
   append the `ingest` entry to `log.md` listing every file touched.
⑨ Log the source row in `MY-INTEGRATIONS.md`.
⑩ Report every file touched; confirm before mass-updating (10+ pages).
⑪ **Crystallize** transcripts/research chains into a `queries/` digest (`references/crystallize-guide.md`).
⑫ **Entity promotion scan** — promote people/companies/products with 3+ attributes
   to their own page (confirm first). Offer a persona page (`llm-wiki-persona`) for any promoted person. If the promoted entity is a person, update
   `concepts/relationship-map.md`: create it (per SCHEMA.md's 3+ person-entity
   rule) if it doesn't exist yet, or add the new person's org-chart row and
   reflect them under their manager's `direct_reports` cell if it does.

### 3. Query
① **Search first**: `view(action=semantic_search)` → grep → file read.
② Read `index.md` to confirm the catalog for top hits.
③ Read relevant pages (only after search identified them).
④ Synthesize; cite pages: "Per [[competitor-x]] and [[test-automation-mq]]...". **For
   a decision-bearing or exec-facing answer, run the falsification pass first**
   (Session Defaults → Source discipline → Provenance-tier guard): tier each claim,
   upgrade recalled claims against a primary source, and route
   targeting/pipeline/quantitative questions to the primary system (CRM, warehouse,
   Gong), not wiki prose. For a casual lookup, cite pages and answer.
⑤ **Select output format**: inline markdown for most; a `queries/<slug>/README.md`
   page for substantial syntheses; add artifacts (Marp/matplotlib/CSV/Mermaid) when
   warranted (`references/output-formats.md`).
⑥ **File valuable answers back** (substantial comparisons, deep dives, novel
   synthesis); skip trivial lookups.
⑦ Append to `log.md`: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] query | <question> (filed: yes/no)`.

### 4. Update (revise existing pages)

Separate discipline from ingest — triggered when new info conflicts with or refines
existing content. **Pre-update snapshot is automatic:** the `pre-write.sh` hook
copies the current page to `_archive/<slug>-<date>.md` before an overwrite
(idempotent, once/day), so "undo that last change" stays trivial.

① **Identify all affected pages** — three-way search: `backlinks.py` (structural),
   `view(action=semantic_search)` (paraphrases), `grep -r` (exact tokens). Don't
   fix one page and leave three with the stale claim.
② **Show diff BEFORE writing**: old text, new text, reason. Confirm for any claim
   touching 5+ pages or changing stated strategy.
③ **Cite source**: every update names the raw source justifying it, in the body and log.
   If that source is new external information not already in `raw/`, either capture it
   there first (§2 ①) or cite it as `[source: user, conversation, YYYY-MM-DD]`. Never
   coin a `raw/`-shaped slug for an artifact that was never captured — unlike Ingest,
   this flow has no raw-capture step, so a fabricated slug yields a citation that
   looks resolvable and no reader can ever follow.
④ **Stale-claim sweep**: after the update, re-search and fix all instances in the same pass.
⑤ **Bump `updated:`** on every page touched.
⑥ **Log**: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] update | <claim/page> | source: raw/...`, listing every file.
⑦ **Write verification**: re-read after writing; if frontmatter is malformed or the
   write failed, surface the error and do NOT update index.md or log.md.
⑧ **Inline provenance on updates**: update the `[source: ...]` marker on the changed
   claim; don't leave old markers on revised facts.

### 5. Lint (tiered report)
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/lint.py "$WIKI"
```
Writes `queries/lint-YYYY-MM-DD.md` with severity tiers: 🔴 (broken links,
missing/invalid frontmatter, off-taxonomy tags, self-referential factual/decision
pages), 🟡 (orphans, index drift, oversized/stale pages, missing coverage markers,
unresolved contradictions), 🟠 (stale overview/index with recent log activity), 🔵
(tag frequency, log rotation). Act on 🔴, investigate 🟠, discuss 🟡, note 🔵. Full
checklist: `references/lint-guide.md`. `--auto-fix` repairs safe issues
(supersession redirects, index backfill/sort).

### 6. Archive
Superseded/out-of-scope content: move to `_archive/` preserving path; remove from
`index.md`; replace inbound `[[old]]` links with plain text "(archived)"; log with reason.

### 7. Staleness Check
Run on "is the wiki up to date?" or after a gap (also runs in orient ⑥). Scan
`updated:` across entities/concepts/comparisons/overview/index (thresholds: 14 days
overview/index, 30 entity/concept). Cross-reference `log.md` — a page with recent
activity but an unmoved `updated:` is behind; flag those first. Offer the Update
flow (§4). Log the check regardless.

### 8. Persona Pages → `llm-wiki-persona` sub-skill
Persona pages and relationship maps are owned by `llm-wiki-persona` (channel model,
no-fabrication rule, relationship-map format). The entity-promotion scan (§2 ⑫)
offers a persona for any promoted person — route there.

### 9. Pre-Meeting Briefing
Trigger: "I have a meeting/1:1 with X". Read the entity page + persona if present;
pull `concepts/relationship-map.md`; read the last 5 `log.md` entries mentioning X;
grep open `question`-tagged pages. Synthesize: **Who** / **What we know** / **Recent
activity** / **Open questions** / **Communication tips**. Log: `## [date] brief | X | pre-meeting`.

### 10. Catch Me Up
`llm-wiki-brief` handles this richer — route there when installed. Fallback: read
`log.md` for the last N days (default 7), list new/updated pages, decisions, open
questions; surface `_status.md` warnings and the 2-3 most active areas. Log:
`## [date] catchup | last N days | X actions`.

### 11. Tag Digest
`llm-wiki-brief` handles this richer — route there when installed. Fallback: grep
frontmatter for the tag → read matches newest-first → synthesize (key players,
recent changes, open questions, patterns) → offer to file as a query page. Log:
`## [date] digest | tag: <tag> | X pages`.

### 12. Coverage Audit
Trigger: "what am I missing?", "blind spots?", "coverage gaps?". (`llm-wiki-brief`
Coverage Brief is richer.) Scan `coverage:` across entities/concepts/comparisons
(count stub/partial/comprehensive); collect `gaps:`; read open `question` pages;
any entity in 3+ pages without its own page is a gap. Offer to create stubs. Log:
`## [date] coverage-audit | stubs: N | gaps: N | open-questions: N`.

### 13. Learn (Post-Task Capture)
Trigger: user accepts Proactive Behavior B, or "capture learnings" / "what did we
learn?". **Read `references/learn-guide.md` first** (dedup gate + classification
buckets). In brief: scan the conversation for uncaptured PM-domain
facts/decisions/questions/contradictions → dedup against the wiki → classify
(entity-update, new-entity, concept-update, decision, open-question, contradiction)
→ propose a compact change list (sign-off if 10+) → execute via §2/§4 → log:
`## [date] learn | <task> | captured: N | updated: N | new: N`.

## Multi-Device Access
The wiki dir is an Obsidian vault: `[[wikilinks]]`, Graph View, and Dataview all
work. Headless sync: `references/obsidian-sync.md`.

## Pitfalls
- **Never touch `raw/`**: sources are immutable; corrections live in wiki pages.
- **Update ≠ ingest**: use §4 for revising claims. Show diffs. Sweep stale variants.
- **Thresholds prevent bloat**: one mention ≠ an entity page (2+ sources or central).
- **Tag taxonomy**: add tags to SCHEMA.md first, then use. No freeform.
- **Contradictions explicit**: both claims, dates, sources, frontmatter flag.
- **Cross-references mandatory**: min 2 outbound `[[links]]` per page.
- **Confirm mass updates**: 10+ pages → user sign-off first.
- **Rotate log** at 500 entries (the session-stop hook does this automatically).
- **Human tone**: PM-facing content. No AI tells. No em-dashes. Natural voice.
  This wins over session-level compression/style hooks (e.g. caveman, terse modes):
  wiki pages and PM-facing output always use full natural prose regardless of any
  active output-shortening directive. Apply the hook's brevity to your own chatter,
  never to the artifact.
- **Private by default (allowlist)**: every page is private and excluded from
  exports unless it carries `shareable: true`. Do NOT add a `private:` flag — it's
  noise the tooling never reads. Set `shareable: true` only on genuinely public-safe
  pages (public sources, no PII / deal terms / 1:1 content).
- **Supersede, don't silently rewrite**: material replacement needs `supersedes:` /
  `superseded_by:` fields; the old page is archived, not deleted.
- **Coverage markers**: set `coverage:` and `gaps:` on entity/concept pages (lint
  warns when missing) so the user can tell a trustworthy page from a stub.
- **Session lock**: `.wiki-lock` prevents concurrent-session corruption
  (session-start writes it, session-stop removes it; stale locks >2h auto-clear).
- **Don't launder wiki prose into insight**: a recalled claim is a hypothesis until
  re-derived from a primary source (Session Defaults → Source discipline).
