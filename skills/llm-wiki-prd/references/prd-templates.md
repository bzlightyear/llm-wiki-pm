# PRD Artifact Templates

Output structures for the three llm-wiki-prd operations. The SKILL.md stub gates
each operation's procedure; copy the matching template here when drafting.

All artifacts use `type: query`, list the path of every consulted page in
`sources:`, list unbacked sections in `gaps:`, get added to `index.md` under
`queries/`, and get a `log.md` entry. See SKILL.md "Output Filing Conventions"
for the canonical rule.

## PRD Draft

File to `$WIKI/queries/prd-<feature-slug>-<YYYY-MM-DD>/README.md`.

```markdown
---
title: "PRD: <Feature Name>"
created: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
updated: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
type: query
tags: [roadmap, decision]
sources: [<list of wiki pages cited>]
gaps: [<list of sections with no wiki backing>]
coverage: partial

# PRD: <Feature Name>

## Problem Statement
<!-- From customer pages, concept pages. Cite: [[page]] -->

## Goals & Success Metrics
<!-- From strategy/roadmap pages, decision pages. Cite: [[page]] -->

## User Personas
<!-- From customer entity pages. Cite: [[page]] -->

## Competitive Context
<!-- From comparison/competitive pages. Cite: [[page]] -->

## Proposed Solution
<!-- From roadmap/concept pages. Cite: [[page]] -->

## Out of Scope
<!-- Call out explicitly. Note if absence of wiki pages is why something is out of scope. -->

## Open Questions
<!-- From open question-tagged pages. Cite: [[queries/open-question-slug]] -->
```

Example `gaps:` population:
```yaml
gaps:
  - "Competitive Context: no comparison page for <Competitor X>"
  - "User Personas: no customer entity page for Enterprise buyer"
```

Log: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] prd | prd-<feature-slug> | pages cited: [list] | gaps: [list]`

## User Stories

File to `$WIKI/queries/user-stories-<feature-slug>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`.

Story format: `As a [persona from wiki], I want [action] so that [outcome].`
Acceptance criteria per story in Given/When/Then form; flag any criterion that is
an assumption with no wiki backing.

**Acceptance Criteria**

## Release Notes

File to `$WIKI/queries/release-notes-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`.

Group by category. Keep user-facing copy clean — no wiki jargon, no `[[wikilinks]]`
in the final copy. Cite `[[pages]]` only in the internal-context section at the
bottom, so the artifact stays grounded while the user-facing sections read cleanly.
